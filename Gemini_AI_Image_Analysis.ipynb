Well, that was usually a hurried affair, often involving something highly processed and lacking in, shall we say, nutritional value*\n>\n>Then came the turning point* I realized how much better I felt - more energized, less sluggish - when I ate healthy, balanced meals*  But the thought of spending hours in the kitchen every Sunday still filled me with dread*  That's when I discovered the magic of *efficient* meal prepping*\n>\n>These two beauties in the photo are a testament to that! Each container is packed with a delicious and satisfying portion of teriyaki chicken, fluffy white rice, vibrant roasted carrots and broccoli*  It’s the perfect balance of protein, carbs, and those essential greens*  It’s also incredibly quick to assemble, a win for my always-busy schedule*\n>\n>My journey started small* I began by prepping one or two meals a week* Then, I gradually increased the number as I found my rhythm*  I learned to embrace batch cooking: doubling recipes, roasting a whole tray of vegetables, and even using leftovers creatively*\n>\n>The key? Finding simple recipes I actually *enjoy* eating* These teriyaki chicken bowls are a perfect example*  They’re flavorful, healthy, and satisfying* And most importantly, prepping them is no longer a dreaded chore, but a ritual that sets me up for a week of success*\n>\n>So, ditch the takeout menus and embrace the deliciousness of meal prepping! It’s a game-changer, trust me*  Want to know my exact recipe for these bowls? Let me know in the comments!\n"

The foliage includes various shades of green and small, colorful flowers in pink and purple.\n",

The colors are bright and saturated, the characters are cute and expressive, and the background is slightly blurred to keep the focus on Krishna.  The rendering gives a three-dimensional feeling, although it is clearly a digitally created image.\n",
